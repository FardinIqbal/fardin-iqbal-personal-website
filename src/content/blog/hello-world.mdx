Welcome to my new portfolio website! I'm excited to share the journey of building this site from scratch using some of the latest web technologies.

## The Tech Stack

For this project, I chose a modern stack that prioritizes performance, developer experience, and visual polish:

- **Next.js 15** with the App Router for server-side rendering and static generation
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Framer Motion** for smooth, professional animations
- **MDX** for blog content with React components
- **TypeScript** for type safety

## Why These Choices?

Next.js 15 was an easy choice. The App Router provides a fantastic developer experience with React Server Components, and the static export feature makes it perfect for GitHub Pages hosting.

Tailwind CSS has become my go-to for styling. The utility classes make it fast to prototype and the design system integration keeps everything consistent.

Framer Motion brings the site to life with smooth scroll animations and micro-interactions without the complexity of managing CSS animations manually.

## What's Next

I plan to write more about:

- Deep dives into projects I've built
- Tutorials on web development techniques
- Reflections on my journey as a developer

Stay tuned for more content!
