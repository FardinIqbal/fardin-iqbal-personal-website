# Big History: Zooming Out

I've been reading about something called "Big History" - a global approach to the past instead of the specialized way we usually study it.

Traditional history is carved into boxes. Ancient Egypt. Medieval Europe. The Ming Dynasty. American History. Each exists in its own course, its own textbook, its own silo.

Big History asks: What if we zoomed out?

## The Problem with Silos

When you study the Persian Empire in isolation, you miss half the story. Yes, Persia conquered. But more importantly, Persia *learned*.

They absorbed Babylonian administration, Egyptian engineering, Greek philosophy. The empire was a synthesis machine. It took what worked from every civilization it touched and integrated it into something new.

You can't see that pattern if you're only studying Persia. You need to see the whole board.

## The Software Engineering Parallel

This hit me because it's exactly how I think about code.

Junior developers learn languages in isolation. Python. JavaScript. Java. Each has its own syntax, its own ecosystem, its own community.

But the patterns underneath are the same. Once you see that, you stop learning languages and start learning *programming*. The syntax becomes incidental.

Big History does the same thing for human civilization. Once you see the patterns - how empires rise, how technology spreads, how ideas evolve - individual civilizations become case studies of universal dynamics.

## What I'm Taking From This

I've started studying history differently:

1. **Timelines first.** Before diving into any civilization, I map it against others. What was happening in China when Rome was rising? What did the Persians learn from Babylon?

2. **Look for the synthesis.** Every great civilization was built on borrowed ideas. The question isn't "what did they invent?" but "what did they combine?"

3. **Patterns over facts.** Names and dates matter less than understanding *why* things happened. The same forces that collapsed Rome are collapsing institutions today.

## The Bigger Frame

There's something liberating about Big History. It makes human progress feel less like a collection of accidents and more like a process with direction.

We're all building on each other. The Persians built on Babylon. Rome built on Greece. We're building on everything.

The question is: what are we synthesizing?
