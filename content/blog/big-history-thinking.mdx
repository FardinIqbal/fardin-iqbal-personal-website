# Big History: The Art of Zooming Out

Fardin Iqbal has been reading about something called "Big History"—a global approach to the past that rejects the specialized way history is conventionally studied.

Traditional history is carved into boxes. Ancient Egypt. Medieval Europe. The Ming Dynasty. American History. Each exists in its own course, its own textbook, its own silo.

Big History poses a different question: What if one zoomed out?

## The Problem with Silos

When the Persian Empire is studied in isolation, half the story disappears. Yes, Persia conquered. But more importantly, Persia *learned*.

The Persians absorbed Babylonian administration, Egyptian engineering, Greek philosophy. The empire was a synthesis machine. It took what worked from every civilization it touched and integrated it into something new.

That pattern remains invisible if one studies only Persia. The whole board must be visible.

## The Software Engineering Parallel

This insight resonates because it mirrors how Fardin thinks about code.

Junior developers learn languages in isolation. Python. JavaScript. Java. Each has its own syntax, its own ecosystem, its own community.

But the patterns underneath are the same. Once that becomes clear, one stops learning languages and starts learning *programming*. The syntax becomes incidental.

Big History accomplishes the same thing for human civilization. Once the patterns become visible—how empires rise, how technology spreads, how ideas evolve—individual civilizations become case studies of universal dynamics.

## Methodological Shifts

Fardin has begun studying history differently:

**Timelines first.** Before diving into any civilization, he maps it against others. What was happening in China when Rome was rising? What did the Persians learn from Babylon?

**Look for the synthesis.** Every great civilization was built on borrowed ideas. The question is not "what did they invent?" but "what did they combine?"

**Patterns over facts.** Names and dates matter less than understanding *why* things happened. The same forces that collapsed Rome are collapsing institutions today.

## The Liberating Frame

There is something liberating about Big History. It makes human progress feel less like a collection of accidents and more like a process with direction.

Everyone is building on everyone else. The Persians built on Babylon. Rome built on Greece. The present builds on everything.

The question becomes: what is being synthesized now?
