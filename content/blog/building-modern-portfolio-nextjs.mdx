# Building a Modern Portfolio with Next.js

When Fardin Iqbal decided to rebuild his portfolio, he knew he wanted something that would stand apart. Not another static page with a list of projects, but something that felt alive, responsive, and memorable.

The result is a site that reflects both technical capability and design sensibility—a portfolio that functions as its own best project.

## Why Next.js

Next.js brings features that make it ideal for portfolio sites:

- **App Router**: The new routing system is intuitive and powerful, allowing clean URL structures
- **Server Components**: Better performance out of the box, with less JavaScript shipped to the client
- **Static Export**: Perfect for deploying to any host without server infrastructure
- **Turbopack**: Lightning-fast development builds that keep the feedback loop tight

## The Technical Stack

The architecture is deliberately focused:

```typescript
const stack = {
  framework: "Next.js",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS",
  animations: "Framer Motion",
  icons: "Lucide React",
  fonts: ["Inter", "JetBrains Mono"],
  deployment: "Vercel"
};
```

Each choice serves a purpose. Tailwind enables rapid iteration without fighting CSS specificity. Framer Motion provides declarative animations that remain performant. Lucide offers consistent iconography without bloat.

## Motion Design Philosophy

Animations should enhance, not distract. Every motion effect in the portfolio serves a specific purpose:

**Scroll-triggered reveals** — Content fades in as the user scrolls, creating a sense of discovery rather than presenting everything at once.

**Hover interactions** — Cards lift and glow on hover, providing tactile feedback that confirms interactivity.

**Magnetic buttons** — Subtle pull effects on calls-to-action draw attention without demanding it.

**Parallax backgrounds** — Depth without dizziness, creating dimensionality that supports rather than overwhelms the content.

## The Custom Cursor

One of the more distinctive additions is a custom cursor—a simple effect that adds personality:

```tsx
function CustomCursor() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

  useEffect(() => {
    const updatePosition = (e: MouseEvent) => {
      setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
    };
    window.addEventListener("mousemove", updatePosition);
    return () => window.removeEventListener("mousemove", updatePosition);
  }, []);

  return (
    <motion.div
      className="fixed pointer-events-none z-50"
      animate={{ x: position.x, y: position.y }}
      transition={{ type: "spring", damping: 30 }}
    />
  );
}
```

The spring physics make the cursor feel organic rather than mechanical.

## Content Management

Rather than implementing a CMS, the portfolio uses JSON files for content. This keeps things simple and version-controlled:

```
content/
├── profile.json     # About, social links, bio
├── projects.json    # Project details with categories
├── experience.json  # Work history
└── books.json       # Reading list
```

This approach treats content as code—versioned, reviewable, and deployable through the same pipeline as the rest of the application.

## Principles Learned

**Start with mobile.** Responsive design is easier when one designs mobile-first. The constraints force clarity.

**Performance matters.** Every animation should run at 60fps. Users notice when things feel sluggish, even if they cannot articulate why.

**Accessibility is not optional.** A portfolio that sacrifices usability for aesthetics fails at its primary purpose—communicating capability.

**Ship it.** A deployed portfolio beats a perfect local one. Iteration happens after launch.

## Ongoing Development

The portfolio continues to evolve. Recent additions include a blog with syntax highlighting, a dark/light theme toggle, and an admin dashboard for content management.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/FardinIqbal/FardinIqbal.github.io) for those interested in the implementation details.
