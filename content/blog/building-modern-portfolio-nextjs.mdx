# Building a Modern Portfolio with Next.js 15

When I decided to rebuild my portfolio, I knew I wanted something that would stand out. Not just another static page with a list of projects, but something that felt alive, responsive, and memorable.

## Why Next.js 15?

Next.js 15 brings some incredible features that make it perfect for portfolio sites:

- **App Router**: The new routing system is intuitive and powerful
- **Server Components**: Better performance out of the box
- **Static Export**: Perfect for deploying to any host
- **Turbopack**: Lightning-fast development builds

## The Tech Stack

Here's what I used:

```typescript
const stack = {
  framework: "Next.js 15",
  styling: "Tailwind CSS",
  animations: "Framer Motion",
  icons: "Lucide React",
  fonts: ["Inter", "JetBrains Mono"],
  deployment: "Vercel"
};
```

## Motion Design Philosophy

I believe animations should enhance, not distract. Every motion effect serves a purpose:

1. **Scroll-triggered reveals** - Content fades in as you scroll
2. **Hover interactions** - Cards lift and glow on hover
3. **Magnetic buttons** - Subtle pull effect on CTAs
4. **Parallax backgrounds** - Depth without dizziness

## The Custom Cursor

One of my favorite additions is the custom cursor. It's a simple effect that adds personality:

```tsx
function CustomCursor() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

  useEffect(() => {
    const updatePosition = (e: MouseEvent) => {
      setPosition({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
    };
    window.addEventListener("mousemove", updatePosition);
    return () => window.removeEventListener("mousemove", updatePosition);
  }, []);

  return (
    <motion.div
      className="fixed pointer-events-none z-50"
      animate={{ x: position.x, y: position.y }}
      transition={{ type: "spring", damping: 30 }}
    />
  );
}
```

## Content Management

Instead of a CMS, I use JSON files for content. This keeps things simple and version-controlled:

```
content/
├── profile.json     # About me, social links
├── projects.json    # Project details
├── experience.json  # Work history
└── books.json       # What I'm reading
```

## Lessons Learned

1. **Start with mobile**: Responsive design is easier when you design mobile-first
2. **Performance matters**: Every animation should run at 60fps
3. **Accessibility**: Don't sacrifice usability for aesthetics
4. **Ship it**: A deployed portfolio beats a perfect local one

## What's Next?

I'm planning to add:
- A blog with syntax highlighting (you're reading it!)
- Dark/light theme toggle
- An admin dashboard for content management
