# Building VerseCraft: A Healthcare Startup from First Principles

Fardin Iqbal didn't set out to build a healthcare company. He set out to solve a problem for people who needed solving.

VerseCraft is a SaaS platform designed for Early Intervention therapists—the professionals who work with children aged 0-3 who have developmental delays. These therapists spend their days helping kids hit milestones, and their nights drowning in paperwork.

This is the story of how that problem became a startup.

## Finding the Problem

The Early Intervention space is peculiar. The therapists—speech pathologists, occupational therapists, physical therapists—are often independent contractors working with multiple agencies. Each agency has its own systems, its own documentation requirements, its own way of doing things.

The result is chaos. A single therapist might:

- Log sessions in three different portals
- Track billing across multiple spreadsheets
- Communicate with agencies via email, text, and phone
- Store clinical notes in yet another system

Fardin discovered this world through connections in the healthcare space. The more he learned, the more he recognized a classic software problem: fragmented workflows with no unified solution.

## The Insight

The insight that became VerseCraft was this: what if there was a single platform that handled everything a therapist needs?

Not another portal to add to the collection. A replacement for all of them.

- **Session documentation**: Clinical notes that meet regulatory requirements
- **Scheduling**: Calendar management across multiple agencies and clients
- **Billing**: Track services, generate invoices, reconcile payments
- **Communication**: Unified messaging with agencies and families
- **Compliance**: Built-in safeguards for HIPAA and state requirements

One platform. One login. One source of truth.

## The Architecture

Building VerseCraft required decisions that would ripple through everything else.

### The Monorepo Approach

Fardin chose a monorepo structure with three main packages:

```
neo-provider/
├── apps/
│   ├── mobile/     # React Native (Expo)
│   ├── api/        # tRPC backend
│   └── admin/      # Web dashboard
├── packages/
│   ├── db/         # Drizzle ORM schemas
│   └── shared/     # Types, utilities
```

The reasoning: therapists work in the field. They need mobile-first. But agencies need web dashboards for management. Both need to talk to the same API, share the same types, use the same database.

A monorepo with shared packages makes this tractable.

### Why tRPC

The choice of tRPC over REST or GraphQL came down to developer experience. With a small team (currently, a team of one), the ability to share types end-to-end without manual synchronization is transformative.

Define a procedure on the backend:

```typescript
export const sessionRouter = router({
  create: protectedProcedure
    .input(sessionSchema)
    .mutation(async ({ input, ctx }) => {
      return ctx.db.insert(sessions).values({
        ...input,
        therapistId: ctx.user.id,
      });
    }),
});
```

And the frontend gets full type safety automatically. No codegen. No API documentation to maintain. The types are the documentation.

### Why Drizzle

For the ORM, Fardin chose Drizzle over Prisma. The reasoning:

1. **SQL-like syntax**: Drizzle's query builder feels like writing SQL, which makes complex queries intuitive
2. **Lightweight**: No heavy client, faster cold starts
3. **Type inference**: Schemas define types that flow through the entire application

The schema design itself required careful thought. Early Intervention has specific domain concepts:

- **Therapists** work with multiple **agencies**
- **Children** are assigned to therapists through **authorizations**
- **Sessions** document clinical work and tie to billing
- **Service codes** determine reimbursement rates

Getting this domain model right was crucial. Fardin spent weeks talking to therapists, agencies, and billing specialists before writing the first line of schema code.

### Why React Native + Expo

Mobile was non-negotiable. Therapists work in homes, in cars, in schools—anywhere but an office. The app needed to work offline, sync when connected, and be fast enough that documentation doesn't interrupt the clinical work.

React Native with Expo offered the fastest path to both iOS and Android with a shared codebase. Expo's managed workflow handles the complexity of native builds, freeing Fardin to focus on the application layer.

## The Hardest Parts

Building the technology was the easy part. The hard parts were everything else.

### Understanding the Domain

Healthcare has regulations. Early Intervention has more regulations on top of those. Each state has its own requirements. Understanding what therapists actually need—not what they say they need, but what would genuinely improve their work—required months of conversation.

Fardin learned to ask different questions. Not "what features do you want?" but "walk me through your day." Not "what's your biggest problem?" but "show me the thing you dread doing."

### Compliance as Architecture

HIPAA compliance isn't a feature you add at the end. It's an architectural constraint that affects every decision.

Data encryption at rest and in transit. Audit logging for every access. Role-based permissions that map to clinical relationships. The ability to produce records on demand for audits.

These requirements shaped the database schema, the API design, the authentication system. Trying to bolt them on later would have been a nightmare.

### The Cold Start Problem

A platform is only valuable if both sides use it. Therapists won't use VerseCraft unless their agencies are on it. Agencies won't adopt unless therapists are asking for it.

This chicken-and-egg problem requires creative go-to-market thinking. Fardin's current strategy focuses on therapist-first value—features that make a therapist's life better even if their agency never logs in. Once therapists love the product, they become advocates who pull agencies onto the platform.

## What's Been Learned

Six months into building VerseCraft, several lessons have crystallized:

**Domain expertise is non-negotiable.** Building for a domain you don't understand is building blind. Every hour spent talking to therapists saves ten hours of building the wrong thing.

**Constraints focus design.** HIPAA compliance, mobile-first requirements, offline support—these constraints eliminated options and made decisions easier. Embrace constraints.

**Technical choices compound.** The monorepo, tRPC, Drizzle stack creates leverage. When everything shares types, adding features is fast. When the architecture fights you, everything slows down.

**You're building two things.** The product and the company. Pitching agencies is as important as fixing bugs. Fardin is learning to split time between builder mode and founder mode—and to recognize that both are necessary.

## The Road Ahead

VerseCraft is still early. The mobile app is functional. The API handles the core workflows. The admin dashboard exists in prototype form.

But the vision is larger: a platform that becomes the operating system for Early Intervention therapy. Session documentation that writes itself through AI transcription. Scheduling that optimizes routes and reduces windshield time. Billing that reconciles automatically and catches discrepancies.

The therapists who use VerseCraft should spend less time on paperwork and more time with children. That's the north star.

Whether the startup succeeds—raises funding, acquires customers, becomes sustainable—remains to be seen. But the problem is real, the solution is coherent, and the work is worth doing.

That's enough to keep building.
