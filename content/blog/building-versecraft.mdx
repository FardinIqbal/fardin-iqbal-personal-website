# Building VerseCraft: Where Code Meets Poetry

I have been contemplating the relationship between form and content—specifically, whether the medium through which art is presented can itself become a form of art.

VerseCraft began as a question: What would it look like to build a web application that honored poetry the way a well-designed book honors its text? Not a platform that merely displays poems, but one where the interface itself participates in the aesthetic experience.

The question led to building. This essay describes what was built and why.

## The Problem with Digital Poetry

Poetry exists uneasily on the web. Most platforms that host poems treat them as content to be consumed—scrollable, searchable, optimizable. The interfaces are designed for efficiency: maximum poems per page, minimum friction to the next piece.

This approach fundamentally misunderstands what poetry is.

The literary critic Cleanth Brooks, in his influential work *The Well Wrought Urn*, argued that the form of a poem is inseparable from its meaning:[^1]

> "The poem is an organism. The parts are not merely related to each other as parts of a machine are related: they are related to each other by being integral parts of a whole. One cannot simply remove a word or phrase from a poem and substitute another."

If form and meaning are inseparable in the poem itself, why should the presentation of poetry be any different? The interface through which a poem is read becomes part of the reading experience. A poem displayed in a cluttered, ad-ridden interface is not the same poem displayed in a space of visual calm and intentional design.

VerseCraft attempts to take this insight seriously.

## The Design Philosophy

The guiding principle was restraint. Every element that does not serve the poetry must be eliminated. Every element that remains must be deliberately chosen.

The design draws from two sources: the typographic tradition of fine book publishing, and the minimal aesthetic of publications like *The New Yorker*.

**Typography first.** The selection of typeface, the setting of line height, the sizing of text—these decisions precede all others. I studied how traditional poetry books set their type. The generous margins. The careful leading. The way whitespace becomes part of the composition.

The typographer Robert Bringhurst writes in *The Elements of Typographic Style*:[^2]

> "Typography exists to honor content... Good typography is measured not by how much it catches the eye but by how readily it transmits its message."

For poetry, the message includes not just the words but the silences between them—the line breaks, the stanza divisions, the white space that creates rhythm. The interface must preserve and honor these elements.

**Immersion over efficiency.** Where typical platforms optimize for time-on-site through endless scroll and algorithmic feeds, VerseCraft presents one poem at a time. The reader is not encouraged to consume more; the reader is invited to linger.

This approach has philosophical support. The philosopher Byung-Chul Han argues that the acceleration of digital culture threatens contemplative experience:[^3]

> "The vita contemplativa presupposes a capacity to tarry with things, to pause. The temporal architecture of acceleration, in contrast, prevents any prolonged contemplation."

A poetry platform that pushes users toward the next poem works against the contemplative mode that poetry requires. Better to create space for dwelling.

## The Technical Architecture

The technical choices follow from the design philosophy.

**Next.js with App Router** provides the foundation. The framework enables server-side rendering for fast initial loads and clean URLs. Each poem has its own page, its own shareable address, its own moment of attention.

**Tailwind CSS** enables rapid iteration on design details. When the line height needs adjustment by two pixels, or the margin needs to respond differently at a breakpoint, the utility-first approach makes these changes trivial. The design can evolve continuously.

**Framer Motion** powers animations that enhance rather than distract. The page transitions are gentle fades. Hover states lift elements subtly. Nothing bounces or zooms aggressively. The motion serves the content.

**Supabase** handles authentication and data persistence. Poets can create accounts, submit work, build collections. The backend is invisible to readers—as it should be.

The architecture follows what the computer scientist Richard Gabriel called "Worse is Better"—preferring simplicity and correctness over feature completeness:[^4]

> "The design philosophy is to give correct results in the normal case, to avoid special cases where possible, and to make each part of the system as simple as possible."

VerseCraft does not attempt to be everything. It attempts to be one thing well.

## The Reading Experience

The core interaction is the reading of a single poem.

When a reader navigates to a poem, they encounter it in isolation. The title. The author. The text. Nothing else competes for attention. The background is calm. The typography is considered. The poem has room to breathe.

Navigation exists but does not intrude. Swipe gestures—borrowed from the mobile-native interaction patterns of social media—allow movement between poems. But unlike the infinite scroll of content platforms, each swipe is a discrete transition. One poem ends; another begins. The boundary is respected.

Ambient audio is available but optional. Some readers appreciate gentle background sound; others prefer silence. The choice is theirs. When enabled, the soundscape is subtle—rain, wind, distant music—never competing with the words.

The philosopher Gaston Bachelard wrote of the relationship between space and imagination:[^5]

> "Inhabited space transcends geometrical space... Space that has been seized upon by the imagination cannot remain indifferent space."

VerseCraft attempts to create inhabited digital space—space that has been shaped by intention, that invites imaginative engagement.

## The Submission System

Poets can submit work through a system designed to be neither too easy nor too difficult.

Too easy, and the platform drowns in low-effort content. Too difficult, and emerging voices are discouraged. The balance requires care.

Submissions go through a review process. Not gatekeeping in the literary magazine sense—VerseCraft does not claim to judge artistic merit—but curation in the sense of ensuring that submitted work is actually poetry, that it is the submitter's own, that it does not violate community guidelines.

The goal is to create a commons—a shared space where poetry of many kinds can coexist, where emerging and established voices appear together, where the platform itself does not impose a particular aesthetic.

The economist Elinor Ostrom studied how communities manage shared resources without either privatization or centralized control. Her principles for successful commons include clear boundaries, locally adapted rules, and participatory decision-making:[^6]

> "When the users of a resource design their own rules, which are enforced by users themselves or by accountable agents, the rules tend to be more effective than those externally imposed."

VerseCraft experiments with these principles. The community of poets and readers shapes what the platform becomes.

## The Theme System

The interface offers multiple visual themes—not merely light and dark mode, but a range of aesthetic options that allow readers to customize their experience.

Some prefer stark black text on white backgrounds—the classic book aesthetic. Others prefer softer combinations—cream backgrounds, brown text, the warmth of aged paper. Still others prefer dark modes that reduce eye strain for evening reading.

The themes are not arbitrary. Each is carefully designed to maintain readability, to preserve the typography, to create a coherent visual experience. The reader customizes; the designer ensures that every customization works.

This approach respects reader autonomy while maintaining design quality. The interface is opinionated about what good reading looks like, but flexible about preferences within that opinion.

## What Was Learned

Building VerseCraft clarified several principles:

**Constraints enable creativity.** The decision to focus exclusively on poetry—not prose, not mixed media, not "content" generally—forced decisions that a broader platform would have avoided. The constraints shaped the design in productive ways.

**Details compound.** The difference between a good reading experience and a great one is hundreds of small decisions: two pixels here, a slightly different transition curve there, a subtly adjusted shade of gray. No single decision matters much; together, they matter enormously.

**Technical choices are design choices.** The decision to use swipe navigation rather than scroll, to present one poem per page rather than a feed, to offer ambient audio—these are both technical implementations and design statements. The architecture embodies values.

**Art deserves thoughtful presentation.** Poetry has survived for millennia because it captures something essential about human experience. A platform that presents poetry has a responsibility to that tradition. The code itself becomes a form of curation.

## The Ongoing Project

VerseCraft continues to evolve. Current development focuses on:

- **Collections**: Allowing poets and readers to curate themed groupings
- **Audio**: Native support for spoken-word recordings synchronized with text
- **Community features**: Thoughtful social elements that enhance rather than distract

The north star remains constant: honor the poetry. Every feature, every design decision, every line of code serves that purpose.

Whether the project succeeds—attracts readers, sustains a community, becomes economically viable—remains to be seen. But the attempt itself feels worthwhile. Poetry deserves better than what digital platforms typically offer. VerseCraft is one attempt to provide it.

The written word endures. The platform that presents it should be worthy of that endurance.
