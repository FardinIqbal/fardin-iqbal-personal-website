Someone asked Fardin the other day what he loves about her.

He began to answer. She is intelligent. She challenges him. She has this particular way of seeing through things, of cutting to what matters. Her laugh. The architecture of her thinking. The way she makes him feel understood without requiring translation.

All true. All completely beside the point.

Because here is the uncomfortable thing: he loved her before he had any of those reasons. The reasons came after. They are post-hoc rationalizations, explanations constructed to satisfy a question that perhaps should never have been asked.

He loves her. He just does.

## The Tyranny of Because

There is a peculiar cultural training that demands justification for everything. Every decision requires a business case. Every preference needs a rationale. "Why do you want that?" is the question posed to children, as if wanting itself is suspicious without documentation.

This makes a certain kind of sense in instrumental domains. One should be able to explain why a particular database architecture was chosen, why this marketing strategy over that one, why the company pivoted. These are means to ends, and the reasoning should be transparent.

But somewhere along the way, this logic of justification colonized domains where it does not belong. It crept into questions of the heart, of meaning, of attachment. It began demanding that people defend their loves the way they might defend a quarterly budget.

The problem is not that people cannot answer. The problem is that they can.

## The Reduction

Watch what happens when someone is forced to articulate why they love another person.

They begin itemizing. She is kind. He is funny. She understands me. He makes me feel safe. They share my values. The sex is good. They support my ambitions.

Each reason sounds plausible. Each reason is probably true. But something has happened in the listing. The person—the irreducible, particular, unrepeatable person—has been translated into a set of properties. And properties are abstract. Properties can be compared. Properties can be found elsewhere.

If kindness is the reason, then anyone sufficiently kind should do. If humor is the reason, then a funnier person should be preferred. If shared values are the reason, then compatibility scores on dating apps should be infallible predictors of lasting love.

They are not.

The reduction fails because love is not directed at properties. It is directed at persons. And persons are not bundles of properties any more than symphonies are bundles of sound waves. The description is not the thing.

## The Philosopher's Trap

There is an ancient observation, attributed to various thinkers across traditions, that goes something like this:

*If you love someone for their beauty, you will stop loving them when they age. If you love them for their kindness, you will stop when they have a bad day. If you love them for their intelligence, you will stop when they say something foolish. The only love that endures is love without a because.*

The logic is almost syllogistic in its clarity:

1. I love them because of quality X.
2. Therefore, X is the reason for my love.
3. If X disappears, the reason for my love disappears.
4. Therefore, I never truly loved *them*—I loved X.

This is uncomfortable to sit with. It suggests that reasoned love, love with explanations, love that can pass a job interview—is not really love at all. It is something else. Admiration, perhaps. Appreciation. Attraction. A kind of sophisticated transaction.

But real love—the kind that does not dissolve when circumstances change, when beauty fades, when kindness fails, when the projections collapse—has to be somehow groundless. It cannot be *because*. It has to simply *be*.

## The Evidence of Duration

Consider the couples who have been together for decades. Ask them why they love their partner and something interesting happens.

In new relationships, the answers come easily. "He's so smart." "She's so driven." "We have so much in common." "He treats me better than anyone ever has." The qualities are enumerated with the enthusiasm of someone who has just discovered a treasure and wants to catalog every coin.

In old relationships, there is often a pause. A searching. A kind of bewilderment at the question itself.

"I don't know," they might say. "She's just... her. I can't imagine it any other way."

This is not inarticulate. This is honest. The love has outlasted every particular reason that might once have been offered for it. Partners have changed. Circumstances have shifted. The person who exists today is not the person who was married forty years ago—not in body, not entirely in mind, perhaps not even in character. Yet the love remains.

What is it attached to, if not to properties? What persists, if not qualities?

Perhaps the love was never really about the qualities at all. Perhaps the qualities were always just the visible surface of something that runs deeper than description can reach.

## New Love vs. Old Love

There is a pattern that emerges when one pays attention.

New love is articulate. It has talking points. It can explain itself at dinner parties and satisfy the curious. "We met at a conference. We bonded over our shared interest in medieval history. He's the first person who really *gets* my sense of humor. The connection was immediate."

Old love struggles to articulate. Not because it is weaker, but because it has transcended the need for justification. It has stopped making its case. It has moved from argument to axiom.

This suggests something counterintuitive: the ability to clearly explain why you love someone might be a sign that you are not yet all the way there. You are still in the process of convincing yourself. The love has not yet become load-bearing. It still requires scaffolding.

When the scaffolding comes down and the structure stands on its own—that is when the reasons stop mattering. That is when "why" becomes an odd question, like asking why you prefer existing to not existing.

## The Test

Here is a thought experiment that reveals something.

Imagine the person you love. Now systematically remove every quality you might cite as a reason for that love.

They become less funny. Less kind. Less attractive. Less successful. Their values shift. Their personality changes. They go through something that transforms them into someone you would not, if you met them now for the first time, choose.

Does the love remain?

For those in new relationships, the honest answer might be no. The love is contingent. It depends on the qualities persisting. This is not a moral failing—it is simply where things are.

For those in old relationships, the answer is often different. The love is no longer contingent in that way. It has become something else, something that does not require the reasons to remain true.

The Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh once wrote that true love is not about finding the right person, but about being the right person—about developing the capacity to love that does not depend on the beloved remaining lovable in conventional terms. This is a high standard. But it points at something real.

## The Danger of Articulation

There is an irony here worth noting.

The more clearly someone can explain why they love another person, the more fragile that love may be. Clarity of reasoning implies that the reasoning is doing the work. And reasoning can be defeated. Better arguments can come along. Superior alternatives can present themselves. The logic that led to this person can lead away from them just as easily.

Inarticulate love is harder to argue with. You cannot defeat "I just do" with a PowerPoint presentation. You cannot optimize your way out of "she's just her."

This does not mean one should deliberately cultivate confusion about one's own heart. But it does suggest that the pressure to justify—to oneself, to others, to the culture at large—may actually corrode the thing it claims to examine.

Some things are better left undefended. Not because they cannot withstand scrutiny, but because the scrutiny itself changes them into something else.

## The Neurological Reality

Modern neuroscience has interesting things to say about this, even if it cannot settle the philosophical questions.

The brain regions associated with romantic love—the ventral tegmental area, the caudate nucleus, parts of the limbic system—are not the same as those associated with reasoned evaluation. Love, neurologically speaking, looks more like addiction than like decision-making. It operates below the level of conscious reasoning.

This does not mean love is irrational. It means it is *arational*—operating in a domain where reason does not have jurisdiction.

The reasons people give for their loves are, in this light, stories the conscious mind tells to make sense of what the deeper brain is already doing. They are interpretations, not causes. The love is primary; the explanation is secondary.

This matches the phenomenology. When someone falls in love, they do not first enumerate qualities and then feel the feeling. They feel the feeling and then, if pressed, come up with the qualities. The emotion comes first. The narrative comes after.

---

## Against Optimization

There is a certain kind of person—often young, often analytically minded, often shaped by economics or technology culture—who approaches love as an optimization problem.

They want to find the "best" partner. They create mental spreadsheets of desirable qualities. They compare options. They worry about opportunity costs. They fear settling. They wonder if there is someone better out there, someone who scores higher on the relevant metrics.

This is exhausting, and it tends not to work.

It does not work because love is not an optimization problem. There is no objective function to maximize. There is no global optimum to converge on. The framework itself is wrong.

You do not love someone because they are the best available option. You love them because you love them. The logic is circular, and that is fine. It is supposed to be circular. The circle is the point.

The optimizer mindset treats love as instrumental—as a means to happiness, fulfillment, status, whatever. But love, at its deepest, is not instrumental. It is not for anything. It is an end in itself. To ask what love is *for* is to misunderstand what love *is*.

## The Particular and the Universal

Philosophy has long struggled with the relationship between particular and universal. How does this specific thing relate to the abstract category it belongs to? How does this triangle relate to Triangle-ness?

Love brings this question into sharp relief.

To love someone for their qualities is to love them as an instance of something universal. Their kindness is an instance of Kindness. Their beauty is an instance of Beauty. They are, in this framing, a vehicle for something more general.

But actual love does not feel like that. Actual love is stubbornly particular. It is about *this* person, not about what this person represents. It is about the way *she* laughs, not about Laughter. It is about *his* specific thoughts, not about Thought.

The medieval theologians had a term for this: *haecceity*—the "thisness" of a thing, what makes it this specific thing and not another instance of the same kind. Love, it seems, is directed at haecceity. It is directed at what cannot be abstracted away.

And haecceity, by definition, cannot be captured in reasons. Reasons deal in universals. They say "because X," where X is a category. But the thisness of a person is precisely what escapes all categories.

---

## Where This Leaves Us

None of this means that reasons are useless in matters of the heart.

Reasons help with communication. When someone asks why you love your partner, they are usually not seeking metaphysical truth. They are making conversation, looking for connection, wanting to understand your world. The reasons you offer are invitations into your experience, not logical proofs.

Reasons also help with recognition. Before you love someone, you can notice qualities that suggest compatibility, that indicate potential for the kind of life you want. The qualities are real, and they matter. They just are not the love itself.

But the reasons should not be mistaken for the thing. The map is not the territory. The explanation is not the experience.

Fardin loves her. Not because of her mind, though her mind is extraordinary. Not because of her laugh, though it rearranges something in him every time. Not because she understands him, though she does. Not because of anything he could list.

Those are the shadows the light casts. The light itself is something he cannot name.

Why does he love her?

He does not know.

And he is beginning to think that is the only honest answer. Perhaps the only worthy one. Perhaps the loves that last are the ones that never needed to justify themselves. Perhaps the deepest attachments are the ones that, when asked to explain, can only say:

*I do not know. I simply do. And that is enough.*
