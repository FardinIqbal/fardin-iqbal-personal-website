# The Axioms of Jiu-Jitsu

It was a Tuesday night, and Fardin Iqbal was getting destroyed.

The purple belt had him in side control. Heavy. He could not breathe right. Every escape he tried, his opponent was already two moves ahead. Not because the man was faster—because he understood something Fardin did not.

Driving home that night, sweaty gi in the back seat, the question arrived: There are hundreds of techniques in jiu-jitsu. Thousands, perhaps. Guard passes, sweeps, submissions, escapes. Every week brings something new. Every month erases something old.

But that purple belt was not running through a mental database of techniques. He was operating from something deeper. Something that made the right move obvious to him when it remained invisible to his opponent.

There have to be first principles. Axioms. The irreducible truths that everything else builds upon.

What follows is Fardin's attempt to find them.

## The Mathematical Connection

Mathematicians have always appealed to a certain kind of mind.

In mathematics, axioms are statements accepted as true without proof. Everything else—every theorem, every proof, every complex structure—derives from them. Euclid built all of geometry from five simple axioms. Five statements about points and lines, and from that emerged triangles, circles, the entire field.

What if jiu-jitsu worked the same way?

There are fundamental truths about bodies, leverage, and control that remain constant whether one is executing a kimura or an armbar. The technique is merely an expression of something underneath. Something more permanent.

If those axioms can be identified, perhaps a practitioner can stop drowning in techniques and start actually understanding the art.

## Axiom 1: Position Before Submission

Everyone knows this one. But knowing it and *feeling* it are different things entirely.

Fardin remembers being a three-stripe white belt, hunting for armbars from inside someone's guard. Getting swept. Getting submitted. Repeating. It took an embarrassing number of rounds before the axiom actually penetrated.

The principle is not merely "get a good position, then attack." The axiom concerns *sequence*. Steps cannot be skipped. The body must be controlled before it can be attacked. An uncontrolled opponent will always find an escape one did not anticipate.

**Position before submission is not advice. It is physics.**

## Axiom 2: Two Points of Control

This one came from a training partner named Marcus.

He was smaller than Fardin but impossible to move. Fardin would get a grip, start his pass, and somehow end up back where he started. Every time. Like trying to hold water with one hand.

One day after practice, the question came: What was he doing?

"You only have one grip," Marcus said. "One grip means I can move around it. Two grips and you start to own real estate."

</svg>

The insight crystallized. Every stable position has at least two anchor points:

- **Mount:** knees on both sides
- **Side control:** shoulder pressure and hip control
- **Back control:** seatbelt grip and hooks

Single grips feel flimsy because they fight the axiom.

## Axiom 3: The Spine Dictates Everything

Here is a strange way to conceptualize it: humans are essentially tubes with limbs.

The spine is the central axis. The limbs are merely extensions of it. If one can bend the spine, twist it, or straighten it against an opponent's will—one controls them.

Most submissions are simply creative ways to attack the spine or its extensions.

  <text x="100" y="115" fill="#ef4444" font-size="10" font-family="monospace">→ fold the axis</text>
</svg>

Chokes compress the neck (top of the spine). Armbars hyperextend an arm away from the spine. Back control curls the opponent into a ball, folding the spine against itself.

Thinking about techniques through this lens simplifies everything. Every position is merely a different angle of attack on the central axis.

---

## Axiom 4: Create Dilemmas, Not Moves

This is the one that changed everything.

A single attack can always be defended. Always. Throwing isolated techniques is merely playing a slot machine and hoping the opponent does not know the counter.

The goal is not to execute a perfect technique. It is to put an opponent in a situation where defending one thing exposes another.

</svg>

Attack the arm, they defend. Now their neck is open. Attack the neck, they defend. Now the arm returns. The best practitioners are not faster or stronger. They simply never present a problem with only one answer.

It mirrors chess. One does not attempt to capture the queen in one move. One sets up a fork where the opponent must sacrifice something.

## Axiom 5: Efficiency Over Athleticism

There is a 58-year-old black belt at Fardin's gym named Carlos. He weighs perhaps 160 pounds. Fardin is bigger, younger, and in decent shape.

Carlos taps him every single round.

Not because he is explosive. Because he is efficient. Every movement serves a purpose. Nothing is wasted. When he applies a technique, it feels inevitable—as though there was no other way it could have ended.

</svg>

Jiu-jitsu was designed for the smaller person to defeat the larger one. That promise only materializes if technique defeats strength.

Every time a practitioner muscles through something, they violate this axiom. It may work on someone of similar size. But it will not work on someone larger. And it will not work when exhaustion arrives in round six.

**The right technique should feel easy. If it feels hard, the execution is likely flawed.**

---

## The Ongoing Inquiry

Fardin does not have this figured out. These may not even be the correct axioms. Perhaps position before submission is actually derived from something more fundamental. Perhaps there are only three axioms, or perhaps there are ten.

But thinking this way has helped. When he learns a new technique, he attempts to identify which axioms it expresses. When a technique fails, he asks which axiom he violated.

That purple belt who crushed him? He was not thinking about techniques. He was simply expressing the axioms more fluently.

The goal is not to memorize a thousand moves. It is to understand the handful of truths they all share.
