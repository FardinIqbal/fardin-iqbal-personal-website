    "bio": [
      "Fardin is in his final semester at Stony Brook University, but he's already checked out of the 'student' identity. Right now he's a digital vagabond - building his own projects, reading voraciously, and figuring out what kind of life he actually wants to live.",
      "His days look nothing like a typical college senior's. He's deep in building a healthcare startup (Early Intervention space), coaching Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu at the university club, and writing essays that explore questions most people don't bother asking - like whether dictators can be good or why love needs no reason.",
      "He's the kind of person who reads Marcus Aurelius for fun, debates the nature of free will over coffee, and then spends the evening debugging a React Native app. Some call it scattered - he calls it following curiosity wherever it leads.",
      "No corporate job lined up. No 10-year plan. Just a relentless drive to build things that matter, understand how the world actually works, and become someone worth being. Currently seeking the next interesting problem to solve."
